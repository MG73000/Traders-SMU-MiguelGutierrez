## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

As a freshman a lot of my background for quantitative finance has been through self-learning online and just a natural
interest in finance. For me it started when I started working with my dad when I was 10 and got my first paycheck. Since 
2017 I have been in watching countless videos on youtube from credit to real estate and trading and just the markets in 
general. I have also been running my own business since 2020 and see the importance of a well rounded knowledge base.
Quant also brings together my knack for coding and technology. The idea of being able to calculate risks using computer 
models is something that really fascinates me. I have also been investing/trading for over 4 years now and wish to get 
better at it through more practice.

## 2. Career Goals

In the short term I would love to work in a FAANG company just to get credibility for my coding skills. This could be 
from an internship or program and I hope to have it by next summer (2026). From there I would move to a more 
financial based company like Goldman or JP Morgan to strengthen my financial skills. Finally by Senior year I can
hopefully combine all these past experiences to land a Quant role in a company like Jane Street Capital or Acadian Asset Management. I would say that my passion is more in asset management but I wouldn't be opposed to something like 
investment banker.

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

The Alpha Program for me is a place to learn the various topics not covered in regular classes. I definitely like
the small group setting because it allows us to get to know each other more. Going over different trading 
strategies that have worked before to me is the most beneficial thing that I can gain here. By setting the foundation 
of what quants have done before we can then try to innovate on top of it to try and build something new in the 
future. I would also say that I can benefit a lot from interview practice since I would say that is my weakest area.

## 4. Current Technical Skills

When it comes to programming languages (Python, Java, C++), Excel,Git, and statistic knowledge I would consider 
myself in the advanced category just because of the various online courses and Hackathons I've done both for myself 
and my tutees. That being said I haven't gone as detailed in statistical analysis, financial modeling or machine learning. 
All these are topics which I hope to improve on but that at the moment I just haven't gotten to. 

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

Through this program I hope to meet other likeminded individuals who can also help keep me accountable in my learning. 
As a start I want to finish Harvard's CS50P and Yale Quant 101 courses online to have a better understanding of quant.
To measure my progress I will look at the different skills and courses I have completed which I hope to showcase
in my LinkedIn. Each week I plan to spend 4 hours, in addition to the regular meeting time, in order to achieve this goal.
For me success would be knowing I have the skills necessary to apply to a quant role and do a good job in such a position.
